# Noteshare

This repository contains my noteshare project.  Noteshare was my senior research project, and seeks to develop a platform that allows users to share notes and other files remotely with other users.  It was primarily focused on homework and had several search parameters implemented to help find relevant files such as subject, date, teacher, or other tags.  Users can upload files to the database assigning various tags such as subject, file name, date, teacher, etc.  These can then be queryed for remotely by any user.

Noteshare was built on a node.js/express backend, and uses handlebars and bootstrap for rendering it's front end.  The database uses mySQL.  It was built on top of TJ's Director web hosting platform, and is currently being migrated to Heroku.  A custom login system is in the works of being implemented.
